     "overviewBody": "Ibanez and Steve Vai have been working closely together for more than three decades - with the first JEM guitar being introduced to the world in 1987 - and the PIA (Paradise In Art) lineup represents their latest collaboration, and is arguably their best yet."

   "keyFeatures": [

     "keyFeaturesBody": "All-New Design Features - Unlike his JEM signature guitar's, Steve Vai's PIA features a whole host of new design features to make it stand apart. To begin with, there's a newly designed PIA Blossom fretboard inlay - a stunning, prominent feature that perfectly evokes the style and artistic vision of Vai. In addition to this, the infamous \"Monkey Grip\" is gone, and has been replaced with an exclusively-designed Petal Grip."
    },
    {
     "keyFeaturesBody": "Unsurpassed Playability - In true Ibanez fashion the neck and fingerboard on this guitar are expertly-designed to allow your fingers to liberally glide over each and every note. In addition to this frets 21 to 24 are scalloped for easier high note bending and finger-tapping. Capping it all off is a newly designed PIA Blossom inlay, which is both beautiful and prominent."
    },
    {
     "keyFeaturesBody": "DiMarzio UtoPIA Pickups - Based upon Vai's own tonal preferences, the DiMarzio UtoPIA pickups have been designed to offer smoother highs, more scooped mids, and a pronounced low-end. These pickups bring together this incredible range of tones with beautiful aesthetics and design elements, making them the perfect fit for the PIA's cosmetic features. In addition to this there's a high-pass filter built into the Volume control (push/pull) which allows you to maintain high-end stability at even the lowest of volumes."
    },
    {
     "keyFeaturesBody": "Rock-Solid Hardware - Ever since the creation of the first JEM in 1987, Steve Vai guitars have featured the innovative Edge tremolo bridge. This bridge and its groundbreaking Lion's Claw tremolo cavity allows you to rapidly increase and lower your guitar's pitch without affecting your tuning stability."

Around 1987, prior to the recording of \"...And Justice for All\", James started to replace the pickups in his guitars with EMG 81/60 pickup combinations, preferring their high-powered output over what he'd been using previously. Shortly afterwards he begain using his first ESP guitar (an MS220 Explorer) and so a legend was born."

Featuring some slight alterations to the more traditional Explorer shape, the Snakebyte was created based on James' own original design. The slightly shorter (24.75\" scale) neck makes for more comfortable playing and easier bends, whilst the 22 XJ Fret ebony fingerboard sports a gorgeous snake inlay at the 12th fret, adding a bit of extra class to the satin black finish and black features of the instrument."
